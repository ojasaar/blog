Before starting this I'd never grown a plant before.
Sure, spending time in the countryside, I've helped harvest and water potatoes, tomatoes, cucumbers, etc. But I'd never seen the process through end to end.

Apart from feeding the entire population, I looked at growing plants as something tedious that old people do as a hobby to kill their excess free time.
This perspective changed when I discovered hydroponics and considered automating it.

## Why hydroponics?

I first stumbled on it at some point in 2017, most likely a random blessing from the YouTube algorithm. I remember being amazed at the fact that you can use technology to deliver the optimal nutrients to each plant in an automated way.

I saw videos of some vertical indoor farms which looked very futuristic.
The plants were healthy and lush. They were said to have grown very quickly and apparently tasted great. I really wanted to taste them.
Growing them vertically made much more efficient use of space and it seemed like a better way to grow plants in many ways.

Fast forward to summer of 2023. I'd gotten really interested in electronics and tired of software engineering related side projects.
During the summer in Estonia, people are growing food all around. Seeing this, the idea re-emerged as the perfect project to learn electronics, get away from the virtual world, and produce something undeniably valuable.

<!-- - Wick system - this involves having a wick transport the nutrients from a reservoir up to the growth medium. There's no electronics involved here, but I've only seen plants grown horizontally using this method. -->
<!-- - Kratky method - here, a plant is placed in a net cup with a large reservoir of nutrient solution underneath. As the roots grow, they gradually drink up the water as the level drops. Again, a horizontal method. -->
<!-- - Aeroponics - this is one of the more complicated methods I've found. The nutrient solution is delivered as mist to the roots. Plants can be grown vertically using this method. -->
<!-- - Drip system - this method involves dripping down the nutrient solution on the roots using a pump. This is mostly done vertically. -->

<!-- ## First steps & preparations -->

<!-- Going into this, I have almost zero experience with 3D modelling and electronics. I've owned a 3D printer for a couple of years so I know how to print models I find online, but that's about it. -->

<!-- I'm fully out of my depth here and I expect to make a lot of mistakes. -->
<!-- It sounds a lot more fun to me to research a bit and try something out. I'm not concerned with the optimal solution. I want to start as quickly and simply as possible. -->

<!-- ## The MVP -->

<!-- Firstly, I need to decide on the type of hydroponics system to build. They all come down to getting a nutrient solution to the roots of the plant. I'll list a few I researched: -->
